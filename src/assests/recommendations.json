Both series often include busty girl designs and some scenes containing yuri undertones. There\u2019s also a lot of drama and gory violence in both shows. A difference is that Cross Ange is a mecha show while Asuka is more mahou shoujo. If you enjoy or are looking for a dark anime with strong female characters and enormous amounts of action then these could be intriguing fits to watch.",

These two series are enjoyable to watch and I\u2019d say are marvelous. Please check both of them out for a superhero anime with tons of lit action and good characters.",

      "content": "\"My Deer Friend Nokotan\" and \"Squid Girl\" are both absurd gag comedies involving a human/animal girl coming into society and causing havoc. Some other similarities include: -a very meme opening which is catchy but also gets annoying -similar characters, whose primary characterization revolves around a gag -pretty similar styles of humor, which usually revolves around the main character misunderstanding or being misunderstood by those around them The main difference is that \"Squid Girl\" takes place on the beach while \"My Deer Friend Nokotan\" is more of a school anime with school-related jokes. If you like one you'll probably like the other though.",

I liked the ending like Beck, it's not forced, it takes its natural course which is what I love about such anime.",

These animes both utilize past trauma as a motive to try and produce a different outcome with the help of the time travel mechanic. I definitely recommend both of these animes as they were fun, sad and beautiful to watch.",
